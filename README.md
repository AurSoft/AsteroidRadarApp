# Asteroid Radar

This is an app for the second project of the Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree.

The starter code of this app can be found here: https://github.com/udacity/nd940-android-kotlin-c2-starter/tree/master/starter

The purpose of this project is to test the concepts learnt throughout this part of the course, such as:
- Implementing a database (Room)
- RecyclerView
- Working with REST web services
- Implementing the repository pattern
- Accessibility (supporting TalkBack etc.)

This is the reason why the starter code already implemented a basic structure, whose knowledge was already tested in a previous project: https://github.com/AurSoft/ShoeStoreInventoryApp
